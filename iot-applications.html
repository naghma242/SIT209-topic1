      <h3>IoT Applications</h3>
      <p>
        An IoT Application is one that runs using IoT devices on the principal of exchanging information through the internet.<br>
        The main features needed are real-time relible connectivity for fast data transmission, security, access to surroundings, easy modifiability, and data handling ability.<br>
        Some examples would be smart devices of all types including wearables like smart watches, home appliances like TV's and smart ovens, safety equipment like smoke detectors etc.<br>

      <h3>Control Interface</h3>
      <p>
        Some High level features of a good control interface involve energy efficiency and sustainability, some level of AI, bidirectional and choice adaptive interactive UI, extensive record keeping abilities with real time monitoring and remote control access, among others.<br>
        The main parts needed are input and output hardware, database system for storing and fetching data, IoT device, software application and internet connectivity.<br>
        The control interface will be used by operators, clients or the target audience, owners and security personnel as well as other devices on the network.<br>
